#pygwidgets  (pronounced as: "pig wijits")

An open collection of user interface widgets for use with pygame development.

To install, open the command line and enter the following:

  python3 -m pip install -U pip --user
  
  python3 -m pip install -U pygwidgets --user
  
The first command ensures that you have the latest version of pip (the installer).
The second line installs the latest version of pygwidgets from PyPI into the
site-packages folder on your computer, so that this package is available to all
of your Python programs.
